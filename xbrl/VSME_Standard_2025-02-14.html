	<h1 id="h1_Objective">Objective of this Standard and to which undertakings it applies</h1>
	<div id="vsme001">
		<p>1. The objective of this voluntary Standard is to support micro-, small- and medium-sized undertakings in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="vsme001_a">(a) providing information that will help satisfy the data needs of large undertakings
				requesting sustainability information from their suppliers;</li>
			<li id="vsme001_b">(b) providing information that will help satisfy data needs from banks and investors,
				therefore helping undertakings in their access to finance;</li>
			<li id="vsme001_c">(c) improving the management of the sustainability issues they face, i.e. environmental and
				social challenges such as pollution, workforce health and safety. This will support their competitive growth and
				enhance their resilience in the short-, medium- and long-term; and</li>
			<li id="vsme001_d">(d) contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive economy.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme002">
		<p>
			2. This Standard is voluntary. It applies to undertakings<span class="vsmeFootnote">[<a href="#footnote001">1</a>]
			</span> whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the European Union (not listed). [Article 3 of
			Directive 2013/34/EU] defines three categories of small- and medium-sized undertakings based on their balance sheet
			total, their net turnover and their average number of <span class="vsmeTerm">employees</span> during the financial
			year.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="vsme002_a">(a) An undertaking is micro if it does not exceed two of the following thresholds:
				<ul>
					<li id="vsme002_a_i">i. &#8364;450,000 in balance sheet total;</li>
					<li id="vsme002_a_ii">ii. &#8364;900,000 in net turnover; and</li>
					<li id="vsme002_a_iii">iii. an average of 10 employees.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li id="vsme002_b">(b) An undertaking is small if it does not exceed two of the following thresholds:
				<ul>
					<li id="vsme002_b_i">i. &#8364;5 million in balance sheet total;</li>
					<li id="vsme002_b_ii">ii. &#8364;10 million in net turnover; and</li>
					<li id="vsme002_b_iii">iii. an average of 50 employees.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li id="vsme002_c">(c) An undertaking is medium if it does not exceed two of the following thresholds:
				<ul>
					<li id="vsme002_c_i">i. &#8364;25 million in balance sheet total;</li>
					<li id="vsme002_c_ii">ii. &#8364;50 million in net turnover; and</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme003">
		<p>3. These undertakings fall outside the scope of the Corporate Social Reporting Directive (CSRD) but are
			encouraged to use this Standard. This Standard covers the same sustainability issues as the European Sustainability
			Reporting Standards (ESRS) for large undertakings. However, it is proportionate and therefore takes into account
			micro-, small- and medium-sized undertakings&#8217; fundamental characteristics. Micro-undertakings are welcome to
			use only certain parts of this Standard as highlighted in paragraph 5(a).</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme004">
		<p>4. Consistency with ESRS for large undertakings has been carefully considered in the preparation of this
			Standard while defining proportionate requirements. This Standard has no legal authority unlike the ESRS for large
			undertakings.</p>
	</div>
	<h1 id="h1_Structure">Structure of this Standard</h1>
	<div id="vsme005">
		<p>5. This Standard has two modules that the undertaking can use to prepare its sustainability report:</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="vsme005_a">(a) <span class="vsmeStrong">Basic Module: </span> Disclosures B1 and B2 and Basic Metrics
				(B3 to B11). This module is the target approach for micro-undertakings and constitutes a minimum requirement for
				other undertakings; and
			</li>
			<li id="vsme005_b">(b) <span class="vsmeStrong">Comprehensive Module:</span> this module sets datapoints in
				addition to disclosures B1-B11, which are likely to be requested by banks, investors and corporate clients of the
				undertaking on top of the Basic Module.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Paragraph 24 below illustrates the available options for the preparation of a sustainability report using this
			Standard by adopting one or more of these modules. Once chosen, a module shall be complied with in its entirety (with
			flexibility allowed under paragraph 22); however, each item of disclosure shall be provided only when it is
			applicable to the undertaking&#8217;s specific circumstances.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme006">
		<p>6. Applying the Basic Module is a prerequisite for applying the Comprehensive Module.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme007">
		<p>
			7. Appendix A <i>Defined terms</i> includes the definitions of the terms used in this Standard. Throughout the VSME
			Standard, the terms defined in the glossary of definitions (Appendix A) are set in <span class="vsmeTerm">bold
				italics</span>, except when a defined term is used more than once in the same paragraph.

			<li id="vsme008_a">(a) how it has had and is likely to have a positive or negative <span class="vsmeTerm">impact</span>
				on people or on the environment in the short-, medium- or long-term; and

	<div id="vsme008">
		<p>9. The undertaking shall report information that is relevant, faithful, comparable, understandable and

	</div>
	<div id="vsme010">
		<p>10. Depending on the type of activities carried out by the undertaking, the inclusion of additional information
			(metrics and/or narrative disclosures) not covered in this Standard is appropriate in order to disclose
			sustainability issues that are common in the undertaking&#8217;s sector (i.e. typically encountered by businesses or
			entities operating within a specific industry or field) or that are specific to the undertaking, as this supports the
			preparation of relevant, faithful, comparable, understandable and verifiable information. This includes the
			consideration of information on Scope 3 GHG emissions (see paragraphs 50 to 53 of this Standard). Appendix B provides
			a list of possible sustainability issues.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="vsme016">
		<p>16. If a sustainability report is prepared to meet the needs of large undertakings or banks that require an

	</div>
	<div id="vsme017">
		<p>17. The primary function of this report is to inform actual or potential business counterparties. The

			undertaking may present its sustainability report as a separate document.</p>

			</b> <i></i> resulting from the activities of the reporting company (as they derive from the undertaking&#8217;s consumed
			energy) which, however, occur at sources owned or controlled by another company. Further guidance is provided in the

	</div>
	<div id="vsme093">
		<p>93. To ensure a fair account of the undertaking&#8217;s emissions, the GHG Protocol has set a list of reporting
			principles:</p>
		<p>(a) relevance: ensuring that the GHG inventory reflects the GHG emissions of the organisation.</p>
		<p>(b) completeness: ensuring that the GHG inventory account for all GHG emission sources and activities within
			the chosen boundary;</p>
		<p>(c) consistency: ensuring the consistency of the methodology used to allow for comparisons over time;</p>
		<p>(d) transparency: disclosing the assumptions, references and methodology used when computing GHG emissions; and

	</div>
	<div id="vsme095">
		<p>95. When reporting on GHG emissions, it is important to set the appropriate boundaries to ensure that the GHG
			inventory is correct and to avoid double counting emissions. The GHG Protocol defines two main types of boundaries
			&#8211; organisational or operational boundaries.</p>
		<p>(a) Organisational boundary: the GHG Protocol defines it as the boundaries that determine the operations owned
			or controlled by the reporting undertaking depending on the consolidation approach taken. There are two approaches to
			consolidation of emissions &#8211; the equity or control approach. The undertaking will choose the approach that
			reflects its circumstances.</p>
		<p>
			(b) The equity <b></b>share <b></b>approach <b></b>relates to accounting for GHG emissions from operations according
			to its shares of equity in the operation. <b></b>
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) When using the control <b></b>approach, the undertaking accounts for GHG emissions from operations over which it
			has either financial or operational control. Companies will use either the operational control or financial control
			criteria when using this approach to consolidate and capture its emissions in the report. <b></b>
		</p>
		<p>
			i. Financial control means that the undertaking has financial control over the operation if the former has the
			ability to direct the financial and operating policies of the latter with a view to gaining economic benefits from
			its activities. <b></b>
		</p>
		<p>
			ii. Operational control means that an undertaking has operational control over an operation if the former or one of
			its subsidiaries has full authority to introduce and implement its operating policies at the operation. <b></b>
		</p>
		<p>(d) Operational boundary: the GHG Protocol defines it as the boundaries that determine the direct and indirect
			emissions associated with operations owned or controlled by the reporting company. This assessment offers an
			undertaking the ability to establish which operations and sources cause direct (Scope 1) and indirect emissions
			(Scope 2 and Scope 3) and to decide which indirect emissions to include resulting from its operations.</p>

			in documenting them and completeness) and are visualised in the image below7.</p>

		<p>100. Evaluating GHG emissions can be done in several ways, including by the calculation approach, measurement,
			or a combination of measurement and calculations. One common approach is based on calculating with use of emission

			determines that its net calorific value of the fuel is 0.03921 TJ/m3. Given that the CO2 GWP equals one, its CO2

			to do so), the undertaking will then provide further information on such emissions according to the requirements in
			paragraph 32. However, if the undertaking does not yet report such information (and is not legally required to do
			so), it is simply required to state this to be the case.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme111">
		<p>111. In general, this requirement is expected to apply to undertakings that are operators of an industrial
			installation or intensive livestock farm covered by the Industrial and Livestock Rearing Emissions Directive (IED
			2.0), amending the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED). The IED 2.0 applies to some 75,000 installations in Europe,
			covering activities such as burning fuel in boilers with rated power of more than 50 MW, founding in metal foundries,
			processing of non-ferrous metals, production of lime, manufacturing of ceramic products by firing, production of
			plant protection products or biocides, rearing of any mix of pigs or poultry representing 380 livestock units or
			more, tanning of hides, slaughterhouses, etc. In these cases, the installation must already report to the competent
			authority the pollutants released to air, water and soil, and the data is publicly available at the Industrial
			Emissions Portal Regulation (IEPR), replacing the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR).
			Companies that operate in more than one facility do not have to report on their consolidated company-wide emissions
			under the EPRTR, as they report only at facility level. This Standard requires the reporting of the total amount of
			pollutants of all the facilities. Similarly, companies owning but not operating in a facility do not have to report
			to the E-PRTR but are expected to reflect their facility-owned emissions in their sustainability report.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme112">
		<p>112. Likewise, if an undertaking has been identified as having to monitor and report on the pollutants listed
			in the E-PRTR under an Environmental Management System such as, for example, an Eco- Management and Audit Scheme
			(EMAS) or ISO 14001 certification. These are in principle relevant aspects for the undertaking to include in its
			sustainability report.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme113">
		<p>113. If an undertaking has only one facility or operates in only one facility, and if its pollution data is
			already publicly available, the undertaking may refer to the document where such information is provided instead of
			reporting it once again. Likewise, if the undertaking publishes an organisation- wide report such as, for example, an
			EMAS report that incorporates pollution data, it can include it in the sustainability report by reference.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme114">
		<p>114. To report information on pollutants in the sustainability report, the undertaking should indicate the type
			of pollutant material being reported alongside the amount emitted to air, water and soil in a suitable mass unit
			(e.g. t or kg).</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme115">
		<p>115. Below can be found an example of how undertakings may present information on their emissions to air, water

			undertaking shall consider the specific pollutants covered by the legislation in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme117">
		<p>117. Examples of key pollutants to air (Dir. 2024/299; Reg. 2024/1244; EC, 2024; EEA, 2022) are: sulphur oxides
			(Sox/SO2 &#8211; e.g. from energy generation and heating in manufacturing), nitrogen oxides (NOx/NO2 &#8211; e.g.
			from transport), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC &#8211; e.g. from agricultural activities), carbon
			monoxide (CO &#8211; e.g. from fossil fuel combustion), ammonia (NH3 &#8211; e.g. manure application and storage),
			particulate matter (PM10 &#8211; e.g. from combustion in manufacturing, transport, agricultural activities), heavy
			metals (Cd, Hg, Pb, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn), POPs (total PAHs, HCB, PCBs, dioxins/furans), ozone-depleting substances or
			&#8216;ODS&#8217;</p>
		<p>(chlorofluorocarbons &#8216;CFCs&#8217;, hydrochlorofluorocarbons &#8216;HCFCs&#8217;, halons), black carbon
			(BC &#8211; e.g. from energy consumption), etc.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme118">
		<p>
			118. According to the Guide for Business on air pollutants emissions adopted by the Alliance for Clean Air, the major
			sources of emissions of air pollutants in the private sector (that are also highly impactful for the entire <b> <i>value
					chain</i>
			</b> <i></i>) include: (a) electricity generation from fossil fuel or biomass combustion (which may be done externally,
			distributed through a national grid, then consumed along the value chain activities); (b) direct stationary fossil
			fuel or biomass combustion within an undertaking&#8217;s activities or industrial processes, or the operation of
			stationary machinery or other activities that require fuel combustion; (c) transport (freight, road, rail, shipping
			and aviation, off- road vehicles such as those used in agriculture or construction); (d) industrial processes (all
			other emissions that do not stem from fuel combustion and that occur during industrial processes); (e) agriculture
			(livestock and manure management, crop production such as crop residue burning, manure and fertiliser application);
			(f) waste disposal (e.g. landfilling, incineration or open burning, or composting).
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme119">
		<p>
			119. The Guide represents an example of a simple methodology for developing a company's air pollutant emission
			inventory and calculating the emissions of respective air pollutants. This methodology is divided into the following
			steps; excluding the mapping of the <b> <i>value chain</i>
			</b> <i></i> as under the VSME Standard the information required by this Disclosure Requirement is to be reported at the
			level of the reporting company: (1) identifying emission sources within the value chain, (2) identifying
			methodologies for quantifying emissions, (3) collecting activity data, (4) identifying emissions factors, and (5)
			quantifying emissions. The guide provides a mapping of sources of pollution to methodologies for calculating
			information on emissions stemming from the main air pollutants (table below).

		<p>
			120. Below is an example of a calculation method for air pollutant emissions using the method for manufacturing taken
			from the Guide above. In the example considered, Mp is the quantity of material M used in (or produced by) a
			company&#8217;s <b> <i>value chain</i>
			</b> <i></i> produced using process p (tonnes, litres); EFk,p is the emission factor for pollutant k for process p (g
			unit production-1); Emk,p are emissions of the specific pollutant k for process p (g).
		</p>
		<p>Emk,p = Mp * EFk,p</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme121">
		<p>121. For instance, a medium-sized chocolate manufacturer producing 1.750 tonnes of chocolate in 2022 would
			apply the default emission factor of 2 to calculate its emissions of NMVOCs, which would result in the following
			calculation:</p>
		<p>1.750 tonnes of chocolate * 2 (emission factor of NMVOCs) = 3.500 tonnes of emissions of NMVOCs.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme122">
		<p>
			122. Transport may be another significant source of air pollution within own operations and at <b> <i>value
					chain</i>
			</b> <i></i> level. In this case, to estimate the emission of a particular pollutant from road transport, for example,
			the entity will need to use the following formula, where FCv,f is the fuel consumption of vehicle type v using fuel f
			(kg); EFk,v,f is the emission factor for pollutant k for vehicle type v and fuel f (g vehicle-km-1); Emk,v,f
			represents the emissions of the specific pollutant k for vehicle type v and fuel f (g).
		</p>
		<p>Emk,v,f = FCv,f * EFk,v,f</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme123">
		<p>123. For example, a light commercial vehicle (LCV) running on diesel that travelled a total of 2.800 km in 2022
			produced the following amount of PM10 emissions (PM10 emission factor of 1,52 g/kg):</p>
		<p>2.800 km * 1,52 = 4.256 grammes of emissions of PM10.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme124">
		<p>124. Fuel combustion is an additional critical source of air emissions. In this case an example of a formula
			may be the following, where FCn is the fuel n consumed within the source category (Gj); EFk is the emission factor
			for this pollutant k (g/Gj); and Emk are emissions of the specific pollutant k (g).</p>
		<p>Emk = FCn * EFk;</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme125">
		<p>125. For example, a company consuming 3.000.000 grammes of fuel in 2020 will have an EF of 0,67 for SO2,
			resulting in:</p>
		<p>3.000.000 * 0,67 = 2.010.000 grammes of emissions of SO2. from fuel combustion in 2020.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme126">
		<p>126. Examples of key pollutants to water (Reg. 2024/1244; Dir. 2000/60/EC; Dir. 2006/118/EC; Dir. 91/676/EEC;
			Dir. 2010/75/EU; and amendment Dir. 2024/1785; EEA, 2024) are: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), heavy metals (Cd, Hg, Pb
			as well as As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn), POPs and pesticides, BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) and other
			Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), substances unfavourably influencing the oxygen balance (measured using parameters
			such as BOD, COD, etc.), total organic carbon (TOC), etc.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme127">
		<p>127. Pesticides and nutrients (e.g. N and P) may be released through agricultural activities (EEA, 2023; UNEP,
			2023) (e.g. manure or inorganic fertiliser application). Heavy metal concentrations may stem from mining and
			wastewater discharges. TOC is a generic indicator of water contamination with organic matter which indicates the
			presence of living material, for example in wastewater, but also surface and groundwater (usual concentration levels
			of less than 10 mgl-1 and 2 mgl-1, respectively). COD widely indicates the presence of industrial effluents or
			sewage, with values that are typically lower than 20 mgl-1 in unpolluted waters and industrial wastewaters reaching
			values of up to 60.000 mgl-1. BOD is normally used to determine pollution by organic matter in surface waters as well
			as for the efficiency of sewage treatment, and it usually features values around 2 mgl-1 in unpolluted waters and 10
			mgl-1 and more in polluted waters. The release of VOCs can be the result of spills to water.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme128">
		<p>128. As for the methodology used to measure emissions to water, the EEA recommends a simple estimation
			technique similar to the one used for the aforementioned air pollutants. In the formula below, ARa is the activity
			rate for activity a (to be chosen based on the specific activity or process; e.g. see Mp in the air emissions
			calculation above); EFp,a is the emission factor for pollutant p for activity a; and Emissionsp,a are emissions of
			the specific pollutant p for activity a.</p>
		<p>Emissionsp,a = ARa * EFp,a</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme129">
		<p>129. Examples of key pollutants emitted to soil (Reg. 2024/1244; Dir. 86/278/EEC) are: N, P, heavy metals (e.g.
			land application of sewage sludge), BTEX and other VOCs, POPs and pesticides.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme130">
		<p>130. Overall, the private sector sources of soil pollution are mainly the products or by-products of industrial
			processes (e.g. production of chemicals, energy, textiles manufacturing), accidental spills of petrol-derived
			products, livestock and agricultural activities (e.g. irrigation with untreated wastewater, poultry rearing),
			production and treatment of wastewater, production and processing of metals and minerals, and transportation (FAO,
			2021).</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme131">
		<p>131. Several national manuals have been developed to support companies in the calculation of their emissions to
			air, water and soil, For example, in Australia and South Africa entities are presented with a few estimation options
			to choose from, depending on their possibilities: direct measurement (e.g. sampling, continuous monitoring system),
			mass balance, engineering calculations, emission factors (same formula as above for air and water emissions), etc.
			The general approach to calculating such emissions is to: 1) identify the emission sources within the facility
			(combustion, manufacturing, solvent evaporation, storage, fugitive); 2) make a stock of the information available; 3)
			identify in the list of estimation methods the most suitable one for the specific process under evaluation, the
			information available, and the measuring tools that can be acquired to get the data that is needed; 4) gather the
			data required for each method; and 5) calculate emissions. The manuals provide several formulas and examples for each
			emissions&#8217; calculation method.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme132">
		<p>132. A list of emission factors for air pollutants can be found at the dedicated webpage of the EEA. Although
			emission factors are more commonly used for air pollution, certain ones for surface water discharge and land disposal
			for specific processes were made available by the WHO. Additional emission factors for POPs may be consulted here.</p>

			133. It is to be noted that the requirements under paragraph 32 are only applicable to SMEs operating in specific
			sectors. Undertakings that are involved in the provision of services (e.g. operating in co- working or shared
			facilities or remotely), for instance, are typically not included in the scope of this disclosure. By contrast
			undertakings carrying out production activities (e.g. chemicals) generally have <b> <i>impacts</i>

			143. <b> <i>Water withdrawal</i>
			</b> <i></i> data can be retrieved from measurements using flow meters or water bills; indeed, in practice for most
			undertakings water withdrawal relates to the amount of water taken from the public water supply network as indicated
			in the utility bills. In cases in which direct measurements are not feasible or are deemed not sufficient and
			therefore need to be complemented, data on water withdrawal can be estimated using, for example, calculations models,
			and industry standards.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme144">
		<p>
			144. For example, in the case of a shared office or coworking space, a possible method to calculate the <b> <i>water
					withdrawal</i>
			</b> <i></i> could be to retrieve the overall water withdrawal of the building from the water bill and calculate the
			water withdrawal per <b> <i>employee</i>
			</b> <i></i> with the following equation:
		</p>
		<p>Water withdrawal per employee daily (L) = annual water withdrawal (L) / (n. of employees in the whole shared
			building x n. of working days).</p>
		<p>The undertaking could then multiply the water withdrawal per employee for the number of its employees and the
			days they worked in the reporting year to obtain the final number required in the datapoint.</p>
		<p>To make a numerical example applying the proposed formula, the annual water withdrawal retrieved from the water
			bill of a coworking space is 1296 m3 (corresponding to 1296000 L),</p>
		<p>coworking space where 100 employees of different companies work together for an assumed number of 240 days a
			year. The assumption on the average number of days worked can be based on national statistics, for example. The water
			withdrawal per employee daily would be in this case:</p>
		<p>water withdrawal per employee daily = 1296000 L / (100x240) = 54 L</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme145">
		<p>
			145. Assuming now that that the <b> <i>employees</i>
			</b> <i></i> of the reporting undertaking are 25 and that they use the coworking space for 220 days a year, the yearly <b>
				<i>water withdrawal</i>
			</b> <i></i> of the undertaking in the coworking space would be the water withdrawal per employee multiplied for the
			number of its employees and the days worked, therefore 54Lx25x220 = 297000 L (corresponding to 297 m3).
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme146">
		<p>146. This calculation could be useful when it is possible to access the water bill of the shared building. This
			simple calculation method has some limitations, as it does not consider, for example, differences in use between
			different parts of the building (e.g. a seven-floor building could have six floors dedicated to offices and one floor
			with a canteen or a restaurant), which the undertaking might be able to overcome if additional data are available,
			further refining the basic calculation provided above as an example.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme147">
		<p>
			147. An alternative way to obtain <b> <i>water withdrawal</i>
			</b> <i></i> data in the example of shared offices when it is not possible to retrieve the water bill could be to
			calculate it using fixture flow rates and occupancy data as primary inputs. A possible formula could be:
		</p>
		<p>Total water withdrawal = &#8721;(Flow Rate&#215;Number of Uses per Day&#215;Number of Days per
			Year&#215;Occupancy)</p>
		<p>where:</p>
		<p>(a) flow rates or each fixture can be retrieved from the project documentation or labels of the fixtures, for
			example, or estimated basing on average data publicly available if more accurate information is not retrievable;</p>
		<p>(b) the number of uses per day can be estimated based on averages publicly available;</p>
		<p>(c) &#8216;number of days&#8217; stands for the number of operational days for the reporting undertaking in a
			year;</p>
		<p>
			(d) &#8216;occupancy&#8217; represents the number of <b> <i>employees</i>
			</b> <i></i> of the undertaking using the office; it is often calculated as full-time equivalent (FTE); and
		</p>
		<p>
			(e) the sign <i>&#8721; </i>indicates that the calculations for each fixture should be summed up to obtain the total
			water withdrawal of the reporting undertaking operating in a shared office.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme148">
		<p>
			148. An additional possible source that could support the reporting of <b> <i>water withdrawal</i>
			</b> <i></i> for undertakings operating in shared offices is the JRC Level(s) indicator 3.1: Use stage water consumption
			user manual as well as additional related documents and calculation sheets (see PG Section Documents | Product Bureau
			(europa.eu)). Furthermore, the undertaking could consult EMAS Reference Document for the Public Administration sector
			and EMAS Reference Document for the Construction sector as well as rating systems like the National Australian Built
			Environment Rating System (NABERS) and certifications like the Building Research Establishment Environmental
			Assessment Method (BREEM), the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and the German Sustainable
			Building Council (DGNB) System for Buildings In Use, which might provide useful indications in their methodologies on
			how to further refine the calculation for water withdrawal in offices and shared spaces.

			sectors, with adjustments that might be necessary for the sectoral and entity-specific situation the undertaking
			operates in. EMAS Sectoral Reference Documents (SRDs) could be consulted for sector-specific methodology and

			e.g. in thermal energy processes like drying or power production &#8211; water embedded in products &#8211; e.g. in

			stress indicator (the &#8216;baseline water stress&#8217;, which measures the ratio of total water demand to
			available renewable surface and groundwater supplies) at sub-basin level. With the help of this tool, undertakings

			disaggregate its <b> <i>water consumption</i>
			</b> <i></i> for that region/water basin. But if its operations take place within the southern part of the Guadiana river

	<div id="vsme173">
		<p>173. The annual mass-flow is an indicator aligned with the EMAS requirements on efficiency of material
			consumption, and it illustrates an undertaking's dependency on specific materials in its operations (e.g. wood and
			steel for the construction industry). The undertaking is here required to provide information on the materials it
			uses, including both the materials acquired from suppliers and those sourced internally from production. To compute
			the annual mass-flow of the relevant materials it has used, the undertaking will need to first identify the specific
			key materials on which its operations are dependent and for which material efficiency needs to be evaluated (e.g.
			material efficiency of wood). If different types of materials are used, the undertaking will need to provide
			separately the annual mass-flow (i.e. total weight for each relevant material used, e.g. tonnes of wood purchased)
			for each key material in an appropriate manner, for example by breaking it down by the use to which they are put
			(EMAS, 2023). The mass flow of relevant materials used will result from the sum of the weight of all used materials,
			including raw materials, auxiliary materials, input materials, semi-finished products or others (excluding energy
			sources and water) and provide the total weight for each relevant material used (e.g. tonnes of wood purchased). The
			mass flow of relevant materials used will result from the sum of the weight of all used materials, including raw
			materials, auxiliary materials, input materials, semi-finished products, or others (excluding energy sources and
			water).This indicator is to be preferably expressed in units of weight (e.g. kilograms or tonnes), volume (e.g.
			m&#179;) or other metric units commonly used in the sector.</p>

	<div id="vsme216">
		<p>
			216. Emission reductions can prove to be both a challenge and opportunity for an undertaking, as it often requires
			changes to the strategic and operational reality of the business. The goal of reducing emissions may require a review
			of strategic and financial priorities. Decarbonisation may require important initial investment in, for example,
			electrifying a fleet of vehicles, implementing new technologies to reduce energy consumption or developing new
			product lines that are less reliant on carbon-intensive materials. On the other hand, implementing low-carbon
			solutions to achieve GHG emission reduction can significantly lessen the costs of purchased energy and materials.
			Undertakings embarking on their decarbonisation journey are often facing important adjustments to their business
			models or daily operations. For instance, a logistics and delivery services undertaking may need to redesign its
			fleet management to minimise potential service disruptions due to the need of regular vehicle charging. A consumer
			goods manufacturing undertaking planning to replace a component of its product with a sustainable, low-carbon
			alternative may need to allocate time and resources to product innovation and to searching for new suppliers. These
			efforts can, in turn, result in reducing costs, accessing new markets, creating new workplaces and attracting
			additional financing, making GHG emission reduction not only a challenge, but also a strategic business opportunity.
			In this context, <b> <i>targets</i>
			</b> <i></i> for GHG reductions are an important measure of responding to the need for a sustainable transition, as they
			allow undertakings to manage the change in a systematic, controlled and organised way.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme217">
		<p>
			217. A GHG emission reduction target is a commitment to reduce the undertaking&#8217;s GHG emissions in a future year
			compared to the GHG emissions measured during a chosen base year. <b> <i>Actions </i>
			</b> <i></i>that may lead to emission reductions include, for instance, electrification, renewable electricity,
			sustainable products development, etc. Disclosure C3 requires that the undertaking discloses GHG emission reduction <b>
				<i>targets</i>
			</b> <i></i> for its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme218">
		<p>
			218. Removals and avoided emissions shall not be accounted as reduction of the undertaking&#8217;s gross GHG
			emissions. This is due to the important distinction between accounting practices for gross GHG emissions (inventory
			accounting) and GHG removals and avoided emissions (project-based or intervention accounting). Gross GHG emissions of
			the undertaking are designed to track the actual emissions released to the environment, providing a consistent and
			comparable baseline to set up GHG <b> <i>targets</i>
			</b> <i></i>. Avoided emissions and carbon removals, on the other hand, relate to specific project activities of the
			undertaking, which means that their accounting is done separately from gross GHG emissions.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme219">
		<p>
			219. To follow this practice, the undertaking needs to distinguish between its gross GHG emissions and other <b>
				<i>impacts</i>
			</b> <i></i> which are not captured in it, such as GHG removals and avoided emissions.
		</p>
		<p>Removals refer to the withdrawal of GHG from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities.
			Examples of such activities can include plant growth (transfer of atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis) and direct
			air capture of CO2 and are typically linked to the subsequent storage of CO2. Avoided GHG emissions are typically
			referred to as emissions that would have otherwise happened but that, as a result of the undertaking&#8217;s
			activities, did not happen. These may include introducing new products and technologies that reduce demand for their
			carbon-intensive equivalents, for example insulation solutions in a building that avoid the demand for energy
			services therein. More information on the concepts related to carbon removals and avoided emissions can be found in
			the GHG Protocol Land Sector and Removals Guidance13 as well as the WBCSD guidance14.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme220">
		<p>220. A base year is a preceding year against which the undertaking&#8217;s current GHG emissions can be
			measured. In general, the base year should be a recent and representative year of the undertaking&#8217;s GHG
			emissions in which there are verifiable data.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme221">
		<p>
			221. The target year is the year in the future in which the undertaking aims to achieve a certain absolute or
			percentage amount of GHG emission reductions. It should range over a period from one to three years from the base
			year to a short-term target. Longer term <b> <i>targets</i>
			</b> <i></i> may also be included, for instance, for periods of twenty or thirty years (e.g. 2040 or 2050). Undertakings
			are encouraged to include target values for the short-term target year of 2030 at the least and, if feasible, for the
			long- term year of 2050. From 2030 onwards, it is recommended to update the base year and target year for GHG
			emission reduction targets after every five-year period.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme222">
		<p>
			222. To set a target, undertakings should consider the existing scientific evidence on GHG mitigation. The SBTi
			recommends a cross-sector target in GHG emissions reduction of -42% by the year 2030 and -90% by the year 2050 (base
			year 2020). The Stockholm Resilience Centre also proposes a &#8216;carbon law&#8217; that sets out concrete steps to
			achieve full decarbonisation by 2050 based on a flexible way of thinking about reducing carbon emissions by halving
			emissions every decade and increasing <b> <i>renewable energy</i>
			</b> <i></i> roll-out exponentially. The authors argued that this roadmap would ensure a 75% chance of keeping the Earth
			below 2&#176;C above pre-industrial temperatures &#8211; the target set out in the Paris agreement15. SBTi also
			proposes a streamlined target-setting route for small- and medium-sized undertakings16. Specific pathways also exist
			by sector and may be considered by undertakings when setting their GHG emission reduction <b> <i>targets</i>
			</b> <i></i>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vsme223">
		<p>
			223. To achieve a quick reduction of both direct and indirect emissions, there are some simple <b> <i>actions</i>
			</b> <i></i> that the undertaking can take. Some actions may be easy but still able to deliver a notable emission
			reduction and support the undertaking reaching its <b> <i>targets</i>
			</b> <i></i>. For instance, electrification of the vehicle fleet by replacing vehicles running on fossil fuel with
			electric vehicles will lead to emission reduction as soon as the previous fleet is replaced. This can mean notable
			emission reduction especially for a business that is reliant on transportation. Similarly, replacing commutes and
			business travels by car with low carbon alternatives such as bicycles or public transport is an effective, simple and
			achievable decarbonisation action. Another area of low-hanging fruit is to review the internal energy management and
			update it to energy-efficient equipment and integrate maintenance into routine business operations. By regularly
			maintaining equipment and machinery and replacing these with more energy-efficient alternatives when and where
			possible, the undertaking can reduce its energy consumption. Such equipment can include, for example, boilers,
			telecommunication systems, heat pumps, air-conditioning etc. Through regular maintenance their efficient operation
			can be ensured, wear and tear minimised and waste minimised. By also

					mechanisms and collective bargaining, including the mechanisms established by collective bargaining. They also
					include mechanisms administered by industry associations, international organisations, civil society organisations,
					or multi-stakeholder groups. Operational-level grievance mechanisms are administered by the organisation either
					alone or in collaboration with other parties and are directly accessible by the organisation&#8217;s stakeholders.
					They allow for grievances to be identified and addressed early and directly, thereby preventing both harm and
					grievances from escalating. They also provide important feedback on the effectiveness of the organisation&#8217;s
					due diligence from those who are directly affected. According to UN Guiding Principle 31, effective grievance
					mechanisms are legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights- compatible, and a source of
					continuous learning. In addition to these criteria, effective operational-level grievance mechanisms are also based
					on engagement and dialogue. It can be more difficult for the organisation to assess the effectiveness of grievance
					mechanisms that it participates in compared to those it has established itself.</td>
